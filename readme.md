## About the Project

Candidus is the result of several months of careful planning and dedicated work. It's a versatile Ghost theme with a minimalistic and approachable design, but a lot of power under the hood.

Candidus has all the features I liked about other websites & themes.

A few I wanted my blog are:

- Bookmarks
- Dark-theme
- Reading indicators
- Customizable texts
- A direct link to ChatGPT

and many more.
